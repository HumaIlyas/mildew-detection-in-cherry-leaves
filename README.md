## Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves is a study showing how to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew, and also the capability to predict if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew. [Powdery mildew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdery_mildew) is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants, and is caused by many different species of ascomycete fungi in the order Erysiphales. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems.

## Dataset Content

The main contents of the dataset are disussed in this section.

- The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves), and it is provided by Code Institute for the purpose of this portfolio project. I have created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. About 50% of the images show healthy cherry leaves and 50% of the images show the cherry leaves containing powdery mildew. Powdery mildew a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio; therefore, the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees, located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

The business requirements are:<br>
1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew.<br>
2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry tree is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypotheses and Validation Methods

Project hypotheses and the methods to validate them are described below. The detailed validation process will be displayed in the dashboad.<br>
1- I suspect that mildew-contained cherry leaves have clear signs on their surface to differentiate them from the uninfected leaves.

- An average image and varability image study can help to investigate it.

2- I suggest that images of mildew-contained cherry leaves will have several differences compared with uninfected leaves in order to train the model with an image dataset.

- The dataset will be analysed using train, validation, and test techniques to investigate the accuracy of image identification.

3- The sample dataset contains images classified as infected and uninfected leaves.

- The binary classification will be the best method to determine the difference between infected and uninftected leaves.

## The Rationale to Map the Business Requirements

### The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

The business requirements of image identification and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks are provided below.

- **Business Requirement 1**: Data Visualization

  - I will display the "mean" and "standard deviation" images for infected and uninfected leaves.
  - I will display the difference between an average infected leaf and an average uninfected leaf.
  - I will display an image montage for either infected or uninfected leaves.

- **Business Requirement 2**: Classification
  - I want to predict if a given leaf is infected or not with powdery mildew.
  - I want to build a binary classifier and generate reports.

---

## ML Business Case

- I want a ML model to predict if a leaf is infected with powdery mildew or not, based on historical image data. It is a supervised model, a 2-class, single-label, classification model.
- My ideal outcome is provide the Farmy foods team a faster method of determining if a plant is infected with powdery mildew or not.
- The model success metrics are:
  - Accuracy of 97% on the train set as well as on the test set.
- The model output is defined as a flag, indicating if the leaf is infected with powdery mildew or not and the associated probability of being infected or not. The Farmy foods staff will do the inspection of the leaf as usual and upload the picture to the App. The prediction is made on the fly (not in batches).
- **Heuristics:** Currently, the process is to manually verify if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew or not. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. Although the staff require some training to detect the occurrance of disease in detail, the image analysis, sample collection, and processing will be faster and could be performed by staff with less expertise.
- The training data to fit the model come from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). This dataset contains about +4 thousand images.
  - Train data - target: infected or not; features: all images.

## Dashboard Design

## Streamlit App User Interface

The dashboard is consisted of five pages provided below.

### Project Summary

This page will provide general information about the project, dataset used for data visualization and prediction, link for the additional information, and business requirements.

- **General Information**
  - [Powdery mildew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdery_mildew) is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants, and can result in a low fruit yield in the case of Cherry Trees. This disease is caused by many different species of ascomycete fungi in the order Erysiphales. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems.
  - Currently, the process is to manually verify if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew or not. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
- **Project Dataset**
  - The available dataset contains +4 thousand images of cherry leaves taken from the client's crop fields:
  - 2104 images of cherry leaves which are healthy
  - 2104 images of cherry leaves containing powdery mildew
